OVERVIEW

The kafs-client package provides the basics for using the kAFS filesystem in
the Linux kernel.  It provides:

 (*) The aklog-kafs program that can be used to authenticate with Kerberos so
     that the kAFS filesystem can perform authenticated and encrypted
     communications with an AFS fileserver.

 (*) A dynamic mount on /afs so that the roots of arbitrary cells can be
     mounted automatically, using the DNS to look up their details.  This needs
     to be enabled by:

	systemctl enable afs.mount

     and can then be accessed by referring to cell names in the /afs/
     directory, for example:

	ls /afs/grand.central.org/
